# Solution: Replace empty columns with NAs.

# Solution: Replace the non-ascii character with empty character.

## Issue 5: There are NAs in the dataset.

# We cannot simply remove the rows with NAs because other columns still contain
# important information.
# For duration column, we can apply imputation. 
# Since duration is MCAR, we use median for the imputation.

## Issue 6: There are composite words in keyword and genre.
# Solution: Melt genre

## Issue 7: Column order in dataset is random.
# Solution: Rearrange column order in dataset.
